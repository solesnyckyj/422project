inputs:
	555t
	RNG seed
	Buttons (need debouncing logic for these){
	RESET button
	Start button
	gameinput0
	gameinput1
	gameinput2
	gameinput3
	gameinput4
	gameinput5
	gameinput6
	gameinput7}

Outputs:
	Score (bits)
	win LED
	Lose LED
	Game board positional LEDs


module Hold
	//This is the state before the game is started
	//only input that gets into this state is RESET
	//only input that gets out of this is start button
	inputs: RESET

	Functions:
	clear score
	reset RNG (set all 7 registers to 0)
		then reseed
	clear game states(win/lose)

endmodule

module LFSR
	inputs:
		SEED
		gameinputX
		555t
		start
	theres a bunch of LFSR verilog examples online
	didnt have time to look for best one
	but it 
	only shifts 
	if 
	gameinputX

	or
	555t @ 3s AFTER start button has been pressed

	or 
	start is pressed in GAME OVER states (win state/lose state)

	IF RESET 
		MOVE TO HOLD STATE
endmodule






module start state
	//occurs after start button is pressed
	takes last 3 registers in LFSR 
		use mux to choose corresponeing game board LED and game board state
		move to mid game state
	IF RESET 
		MOVE TO HOLD STATE
endmodule



module mid game state
	
	if corresponding gameinputX button is hit for game board LED X AND 555t < 3s
		if score <= 9
			score +1
			shift LFSR
		if score > 9
			move to WIN state

	if 555t reaches 3 seconds
		score = 0
		move to LOSE state

	IF RESET 
		MOVE TO HOLD STATE
endmodule

module LOSE state
	display no score 
		(or score = 0)
	light up LOSE LED
	if start button
		move to Start state
